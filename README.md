##Facebook Messenger for Linux (and Mac!)
![screenshot](https://github.com/oconnor663/fbmessenger/raw/master/resources/screenshot.png)

A PyQt clone of [Facebook Messenger for
Windows](https://www.facebook.com/about/messenger). It gives you a chat
sidebar, chat popup windows, and notification toasts outside of the browser.

If you have all the dependencies, you can launch the app straight from this
repository with `./run.sh`. After you install it, you can launch it with
`fbmessenger`. Ubuntu users can install from a PPA by following [the
instructions
here](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/fbmessenger-stand-alone-facebook.html)
(thanks Alin Andrei). Arch users can [install from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fbmessenger-git/).  There are packaging
scripts included under `packaging/` for Linux (Debian/Ubuntu in `deb`, Red
Hat/Fedora in `rpm`, and Arch) and OS X (using the Homebrew package manager).
See the `README` files in packaging subdirectories for more specific
instructions. You can also install with `sudo python3 setup.py install`, but
that makes it hard to uninstall, so prefer to use the packaging scripts.

The configuration file is `~/.fbmessenger/config.py`. There are a few settings
that users might want to mess with.

`Zoom`; set a value like `Zoom = 1.2` to make the fonts 20% bigger.

`SystemTray`; set it to `SystemTray = False` to disable the system tray.

`MinimizedOnStart`; it is only valid if the `SystemTray` option set to True.
Set `MinimizedOnStart = True` if you want force the app to be minimized to tray
on start (otherwise the app will start according to the last minimized status).
